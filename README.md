homebrew-haskell
================

You found this repository because here because the existing GHC formula is not updated as frequently as I would like. In addition, I need a GHC formula that allows me to install multiple versions of ghc side by side so I can easily switch between them.

How to use it?
==============

First add the homebrew-ghc tap:

```bash
brew tap rodlogic/homebrew-ghc
```

Now install ghc-7.8.3:

```bash
brew install ghc78
```
